 *  How to use it?
 *  $(ele).loader();   //simple loader with circle and text
 *  $(ele).loader(1);  //simple loader with circle and text
 *  $(ele).loader([2,"imgurl"]);  //simple loader with circle and text and a PICTURE! Imgurl is the src.
 *  How to close the loader when it shows?
 *  $(any ele).modal_close();
 *  It will close the loader which you just open.Every Loader has a unique id,and you can't open two loader.
 *  You must close the last one, and you can get a new loader.
 *  Now it has some simple loader,but i will make it better(More style loader!)
